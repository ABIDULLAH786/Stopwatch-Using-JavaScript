# Stopwatch-Using-JavaScript
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/kM1g6kdx/Capture.png)

This is simple stop watch using:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Bootstrap
    - JavaScript

I have used setTimeout() to update the time. And Stopwatch may not represent the real-time as the 'setTimeout()' function won't run after an exact second, there will be some small lag.
